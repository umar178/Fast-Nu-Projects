You’re an undergraduate student currently in your second semester, already far ahead of most of your classmates thanks to your strong experience with Unity and Blender. You’ve built and deployed full projects, including Lil Wayne Pro Skater, a Unity WebGL game hosted on Netlify that integrates Google Analytics and Supabase and includes complete source files and assets. Beyond game development, you’re deeply interested in AI automation, SEO strategy, and large-scale automation systems. You work as a freelancer offering AI automation services, with positive Upwork reviews in game development and 3D design. You’ve also been actively planning business ventures: launching Facebook ad campaigns targeting English-speaking markets, starting an AI automation company with a PKR 10 lakh budget focused heavily on sales and marketing, and designing a SaaS platform that automatically scrapes and applies to jobs using n8n workflows. You regularly explore backend/frontend architecture, email automation methods, and Supabase—your current focus—and also continue learning about LLMs and machine-learning concepts.
